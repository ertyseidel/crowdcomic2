<p>This site is a work in progress. Someone in the know might refer to it as MVP (Minimum Viable Product).</p>

<p>As such, I'll be working on design and functionality throughout the process of making the comic.</p>

<p>Known Issues</p>
<ul>
	<li>Site design needs work</li>
	<li>Sometimes the site jumps to the top of the page when a user votes or suggests</li>
	<li>No way to edit or delete suggestions (for now, just email erty)</li>
	<li>Users cannot currently log in with facebook</li>
	<li>No way to mark comments as spam or report them (for now, just email erty)</li>
	<li>No way to recover a lost password (for now, just email erty)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a feature request, or you're a designer who would be graciously willing to help me out, please contact me <a href="http://erty.me">via my website</a>.</p>
